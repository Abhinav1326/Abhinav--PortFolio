# Portfolio Site

This is my portfolio site, where I showcase my projects and skills. It is built using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the help of GSAP and Locomotive.js libraries.

## Features

- Responsive design: The site is optimized for different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Smooth animations: GSAP library is used to create smooth and engaging animations, adding a touch of interactivity to the site.
- Scroll navigation: Locomotive.js is implemented to provide smooth scrolling and navigation between different sections of the site.

## Getting Started

To run the portfolio site locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Feel free to customize the site to fit your own needs. Update the content, add your own projects, and modify the styling as desired.
